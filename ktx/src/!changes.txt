 7. i changed a bit k_freeze localinfo, so if 'localinfo k_freeze 1' this let us
	freeze level _right_ after level spawn, in native Kteams or ktpro trains or plats
    will move one time,	even k_freeze is set

 6. mmm, quote from ktpro
	//aerowalk map support 
	//imo it is greatest map for 1/1, maybe with quad it will be also good for 2/2 ?:)
	localinfo add_q_aerowalk 1 //adds quad on aerowalk

2007-09-06
 3. mostly added ktpro timing feature

	//timing/full laged players manipulation
	localinfo allow_timing 1         //allow modside manipulatuion
	localinfo timing_players_time 1  //6 seconds default

	localinfo timing_players_action 3   //only info and glow
                                  		//bit mask - you must add values to define proper action
                                  		//1 - info, 2 - glow, 4 - invincible, 8 - autokpause
                                  		//so if you want make invincible and glow 
                                  		//it should be: 2 + 4 = 6

	TODO: check code about client connect during mod is paused i.e. k_pause != 0

 	->s.v.nextthink trouble

 4. localinfo k_remove_end_hurt 1 //remove hurt trigger on map end

 5. //mod can remove gibs after 2 seconds so players can not use gibs filter
	localinfo k_short_gib 1

 1. added 'dmm1' 'dmm2' 'dmm3' 'dmm4' 'dmm5' command.
	'dm' is just show dmm.

	'dmm6' 'dmm7' 'dmm8' is unsupported!!!

 2.	heh, if u an admin, ktpro XonX usermode command
 	set localinfo k_fallbunny 0, always,
 	so I introduce 'k_umfallbunny', which is just control which value
 	must be set to 'k_fallbunny' after XonX (u are must be admin too).

'official' command removed due to '4on4' existence

2007-08-28 night %)
added 1on1 2on2 3on3 4on4 10on10 and ffa commands

for example 1on1 on dm6 will setup some predefined stuff for this
command and exec this files:
	"exec configs/usermodes/default.cfg\n"
	"exec configs/usermodes/dm6.cfg\n"
	"exec configs/usermodes/1on1/default.cfg\n"
	"exec configs/usermodes/1on1/dm6.cfg\n"

and some localinfos

'k_free_mode'

for 1on1 / 2on2 / 4on4 and ffa commands manipulation
0 - noone, 1 - admins, 2 elected admins too
3 - only real real judges, 4 - elected judges too
5 - all players

hmm, I didn't understand how k_free_mode affect this commands in ktpro,
so implement how i think this must be, it is like some sort of access control

'k_allowed_free_modes'  //for possible 1on1 2on2 etc commands
//you have to add all needed values like in fpd for allowing what you want:
//1on1 = 1, 2on2 = 2, 3on3 = 4, 4on4 = 8, 10on10 = 16, ffa = 32
//localinfo k_allowed_free_modes 63 means that all modes are allowed
//63 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32

all maps, even native eXmY dm1-dm6 start and end, uses `cmd cc <value>`, only
few impulse commands exist, like weapon changing and some spectator stuff.

TODO: remove latest impulses except weapon and so on.

better code for stuffing maps and commands

added setinfo 'ss' like in ktpro
quote from ktpro
ss - used to control the speed at which aliases are stuffed to you when connecting
--          to a KTeams Pro server, default value is 4 which means one alias every
            0.04 seconds, the smallest possible value is 1 and only integer values are 
            accepted
            
                     example: setinfo ss 1
                     
                     this will cause the server to stuff you one alias every 0.01 seconds

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	if u don't know, u can use `check_maps` at server console for generating
	stuff like this in the server localinfo

	localinfo 1000 ukooldm1
	localinfo 1001 ukooldm2
	localinfo 1002 ukooldm3

	so u may not do this manually, just put this command some where
	in the server config file. Oh, and this is MVDSV feature.

brokenankle worked now

TODO: it just blok +jump for one frame, so this can be ezly escaped via cheatish client,
	  so current implementation(Kteams 2.21 and i think ktpro too) is suck,
	  but as for me i prefer disable brokenankle at all
