# KTX: a QuakeWorld server modification
![KTX Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QW-Group/ktx/master/resources/logo/ktx.png)

**[KTX][ktx]** (Kombat Teams eXtreme) is a popular **QuakeWorld** server modification, adding numerous features to the core features of the server.

Although it had been developed to be **Quakeworld** server agnostic, it has over the years been developed very close to **[MVDSV][mvdsv]** to which it has become an extent, thus compatibility with other **Quakeworld** servers might not have been maintained.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will help you get **[KTX][ktx]** installed on a running **[MVDSV][mvdsv]** server using prebuilt binaries. Details on how to compile your own **[KTX][ktx]** binary will also be included to match specific architectures or for development purposes.

## Supported architectures

The following architectures are fully supported by **[KTX][ktx]** and are available as prebuilt binaries:
* Linux amd64 (Intel and AMD 64-bits processors)
* Linux i686 (Intel and AMD 32-bit processors)
* Linux aarch (ARM 64-bit processors)
* Linux armhf (ARM 32-bit processors)
* Windows x64 (Intel and AMD 64-bits processors)
* Windows x86 (Intel and AMD 32-bit processors)

## Prebuilt binaries

You can find the prebuilt binaries on [this download page][ktx-builds].

## Prerequisites

**[KTX][ktx]** is a server mod and won't run without a proper **Quakeworld** server set up. **[MVDSV][mvdsv]** is the recommended one, but **[FTE][fte]** might work as well (unconfirmed with current code).

## Installing

For more detailed information we suggest looking at the [nQuake server][nquake-linux], which uses **[MVDSV][mvdsv]** and **[KTX][ktx]** as **QuakeWorld** server.

## Building binaries

### Build from source with CMake

Assuming you have installed essential build tools and ``CMake``
```bash
mkdir build && cmake -B build . && cmake --build build
```
Build artifacts would be inside ``build/`` directory, for unix like systems it would be ``qwprogs.so``.

You can also use ``build_cmake.sh`` script, it mostly suitable for cross compilation
and probably useless for experienced CMake user.
Some examples:
```
./build_cmake.sh linux-amd64
```
should build KTX for ``linux-amd64`` platform, release version, check [cross-cmake](tools/cross-cmake) directory for all platforms

```
B=Debug ./build_cmake.sh linux-amd64
```
should build KTX for linux-amd64 platform with debug

```
V=1 B=Debug ./build_cmake.sh linux-amd64
```
should build KTX for linux-amd64 platform with debug, verbose (useful if you need validate compiler flags)

```
V=1 B=Debug BOT_SUPPORT=OFF ./build_cmake.sh linux-amd64
```

same as above but compile without bot support

```
G="Unix Makefiles" ./build_cmake.sh linux-amd64
```

force CMake generator to be unix makefiles

```
./build_cmake.sh linux-amd64 qvm
```

build KTX for ``linux-amd64`` and ``QVM`` version, you can provide
any platform combinations.

### Build with Visual Studio

While CMake is supported by Visual Studio nowadays, CMake can also generate
a solution via:

```
cmake -B builddir -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
```

This produces a multi-config build that can be invoked as MSBuild from command line via:

```
cmake --build builddir --config Release
```
