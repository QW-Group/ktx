KTX
===

[KTX] is a popular **Quakeworld™** server modification, adding numerous features to the core features of the server.

Although it had been developed to be **Quakeworld™** server agnostic, it has over the years been developed very close to [MVDSV] to which it has become an extent, thus compatibility with other **Quakeworld™** servers might not have been maintained.
